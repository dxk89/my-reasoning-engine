# render.yaml

# This Render configuration defines a single web service for the
# my‑reasoning‑engine application.  It installs Google Chrome into
# Render’s persistent storage during the build step so that Selenium
# can locate a browser binary at runtime.  The start command adds
# Chrome’s location to the PATH and then launches the application via
# uvicorn.

    # Install Chrome and dependencies before running pip install.
    # The render-build.sh script will download Google Chrome into the
    # persistent storage directory (.render/chrome) and cache it so
    # subsequent builds are faster.
    buildCommand: |
      # Install Chrome into persistent storage if not already cached
      bash render-build.sh
      # Install Python dependencies
      pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Prepend Chrome’s location to the PATH before launching the app.
    # This allows Selenium to find the chrome binary without needing to
    # hardcode a path in your Python code.  uvicorn is used here to run
    # the FastAPI application defined in app.server.
